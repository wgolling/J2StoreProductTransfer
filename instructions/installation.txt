|| Instructions for installing New Products Transfer system. ||

--------------------------------------------------------------|

**You will need administrator access to both the local server and live server!**

"->" means "essential step"    "--" means "something to be aware of"


Set Up Live Site:
----------------
-> add the following folder: <live_website_root>/exports/NewParts/


Set Up Local Copy Of Website:
----------------------------
-> create the file <local_website_root>/exports/NewParts/last_run.txt
	-- this file will record the last time the "New Parts Export" template was run.
-> write a datetime to this file, in the format "Y-m-d H:i:s". 
	-- Any product created after this datetime will in principle be included in the next export.


Restore ROCSVI Templates:
-------------------------
-> move the template override "productcustom.php" to the following folder:
    <local_website_root>/administrator/templates/isis/html/com_csvi/com_j2store/model/export/
    -- you will likely need to create this folder
    -- if using an administrator template other than "isis", replace it in the path
-> local site needs a "Complete Products Export" template, with the template override Productcustom.
	-- template overrides can be selected by clicking "Advanced" in the Details menu
	-- the Productcustom override will ensure it only exports those items created after the last export
	-- a template example is given in templates/ROCSVI/csvi_export_new.xml
-> live site needs "Complete Products Import"
	-- a template example is given in templates/ROCSVI/csvi_complete_import.xml
	-- this template will be called by the script import_all.sh, make sure that cron is enabled
-> ammend the paths in the configuration for both of these templates, to make sure they are consistent with the particular environments.


"Install" Scripts:
-----------------
-> install transfer_files.php:
	-> put in a folder on the local server 
		-- preferably a location *outsite* of the website's folder in case you need to download a fresh copy of the website.
	-> change the paths and FTP user information as appropriate.
-> install import_all.sh:
	-> put on the live site in <live_website_root>/exports/NewParts/
	-> make sure the PHP path is valid for your live server
	-> check the name and Secret key in the command to make sure it matches the information in your "Complete Products Import" template.
	-> *make sure it is executable!* so it can be run by a cron job.


Set up Cron Jobs:
----------------
-> every <regular_interval> the local site should run the transfer_files.php, and the live site should run import_all.sh .
-- cron job examples for local and live servers are found in the cronjobs folder. Take care to alter the paths as appropriate.
-> DasParts has a Mac, so you can use "crontab transfer_files_cron.txt" to set the cronjobs using that file. *Note that this will overwite any cron jobs they already have!* You can see the current cronjobs by typing "crontab -l". To edit the cron jobs file directly you can use "crontab -e", which opens the file in the default Terminal editor (probably VIM). 
-- in order to run the local script transfer_files.php, you need to use the *full path* to the local machine's PHP. 
	-- DasParts has a Mac: 
		-- you can use "which php" in the Terminal to get the path for the OS' PHP installation
		-- if their OS doesn't have PHP installed by default, you can use MAMP's. The PHP installation for my MAMP server is at 
			/Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php7.2.8/bin/php 
		Other MAMP installations on Mac would have an analoguous path to the most recent PHP version.
-- If the live script import_all.sh is set as executable, you can run it directly with a cron job.
