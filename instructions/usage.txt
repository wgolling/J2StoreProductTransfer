After you have added your new parts and are satisfied with their state, go to the folowing location in the Joomla administrator control panel:

Components -> RO CSVI -> Export

Select "Export New Products" and click "Export".

The rest will happen automatically, assuming the cronjobs have been properly set up.

(Could also make a front-end menu item with administrator-only privileges.)
